# NC NEWS FRONTEND SOFTWARE DEVELOPEMENT PROJECT
I completed this project as part of my Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp. In this Project, I developed responsive UI and accessible pages and fetched data from backend Api which I developed as part of my backend project[my backednd Repo]((https://github.com/SuganyaArul/nc_news_api) ).
User can view all the news articles , based on specific topic and they can sort articles by date, votes and comment_count.
When you click on article user can view single article page with all comments and allow user to add new comment, if they change their mind it allow user to delete the comments as well. User can like or dislike the article by clicking the like or dislike button. It is live now , deployed on Netlify at https://sanewsarticle.netlify.app/ where you can view NC NEWS webpage.
